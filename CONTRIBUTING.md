# Contributing

TLDR: Please contribute! It will help the growth of the language a ton and we will thank you!

Rule of contributing goes as follows:
- Any edits to documentation should go in the `docs` branch.
- New features should be commited into `dev`.
- Bugfixes, or debugging tools, belong in `bugfix`.
- Before merging `bugfix` into `dev`, any debug tools are removed in `bugfix-remove-debug`. They should still be there in `bugfix` if needed.

Here are some edits we would like:
- Bugfixes, or something that makes progress towards fixing a bug
- Typos in documentation
- New features (Although they may not be approved)

Here are some edits we would not like:
- Renaming variables (unless there is a typo)
- Changing formatting method (unless there are mixed formatting; always assume tabs)
- Additions to documentation that claim something is "coming soon" without permission from the author
- Additions to documentation that are untrue or try to mask the truth
